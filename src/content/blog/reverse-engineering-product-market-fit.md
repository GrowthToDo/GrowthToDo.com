Product market fit is not dead. But the version most people have been taught is deeply incomplete.

This post is a written distillation of a live session titled “Reverse Engineering Product Market Fit: A Data Driven Approach”, delivered at the Roach Mafia meetup in December 2024. The goal of the session was simple. Cut through startup mythology, remove opinion driven product building, and replace it with a framework that improves your odds of building something people actually want and are willing to pay for.

This is not a formula. It is an error minimisation framework.

## Why this exists

Most founders fail for a boring reason.

They do two out of three things well:
- They solve a real problem but cannot find people who have it.
- They find an audience but cannot charge sustainably.
- They ship something impressive that nobody truly needs.

A real business must do all three:
1. Solve a real problem.
2. Find people who have that problem.
3. Charge more than it costs to solve it, sustainably.

Miss any one, and you do not have a business. You have a project.

## PMF is too narrow as a concept

Product market fit, as commonly discussed, hides too much complexity. It compresses several independent forces into one vague term.

A clearer model is what I call AODM Fit:
- Audience
- Offering
- Distribution
- Money

A product without distribution is dead on arrival.
Distribution without a real painkiller product leads to slow death.
Money is not an afterthought. It is a constraint that shapes everything upstream.

This fit is part art and part science. Ignore either and you pay for it later.

## You are not 50 Cent

Most advice assumes you have money, reach, or leverage. You probably do not.

Your real advantage is something else:
People have already spoken.
They have searched.
They have bought.
They have complained.
They have reviewed.
They have migrated.

The data already exists. The question is whether you are willing to listen.

## Ideation should start with listening, not guessing

Survey data is weak.
Search data is strong.
Sales data is unbeatable.

Instead of asking people what they want, observe what they already do.

Some reliable places to listen:
- Search queries over time.
- Products people are buying at scale.
- Alternatives people are actively looking for.
- Reviews, complaints, and migration stories.
- Communities where people discuss work, tools, and pain honestly.

Good ideation often comes from asking better questions, not having better ideas.

Questions like:
- What do these people hate doing?
- What do they keep postponing?
- What do they do badly but think they are good at?
- What do they pay for but complain about?
- What do they know they need but are in denial about?

## Build for a specific audience, not everyone

If your solution depends on “if everyone would just…”, you do not have a solution.

Everyone will not just.
They never have.
They never will.

Pick a narrow audience.
Understand them deeply.
Figure out what they already spend money on.
Then design something better, cheaper, simpler, or more aligned.

Your first business is not your last business.
Revenue teaches faster than perfection ever will.

## Validation starts in the mind, but ends in the real world

Mental validation is about speed and cost.
Real validation is about friction and commitment.

Some fast validation signals:
- Can you rank and attract the right people?
- Will they join a waitlist without incentives?
- Will they reply when you reach out directly?
- Will they pay, even at a discounted price?

Nothing produces useful information like real world action.
Thinking does not clarify problems.
Doing does.

Clarity emerges while moving, not before.

## Distribution is not optional

Many first time founders obsess over product and ignore distribution.
Repeat founders do the opposite.

If you cannot get people to a page, see an offer, and pay, you do not know how to sell that product online.

Start small:
- A single landing page.
- A simple free tool.
- One focused piece of content.
- One community where your audience already hangs out.

Build the smallest surface area that attracts the right people.

## Crafting an offer that converts

Great products still fail with weak offers.

Some proven patterns:
- Show and sell sessions where value and conversion happen together.
- Limited time or limited access deals.
- Referral loops that reward early users.
- Free tools that naturally upsell into paid products.
- Gamified early access.

If you cannot get 100 of your target users to show up, learn, and buy, you do not understand them well enough yet.

## The antithesis

Doing all of this does not guarantee a win.

You will see people ignore all advice and still succeed.
There are thousands of ways to win.

This framework does not promise success.
It improves odds.
It reduces blind spots.
It helps you fail faster and with more awareness.

If this overwhelms you, stop.
Pick one or two ideas.
Act.
Learn.
Iterate.

Overconsumption of frameworks is its own form of procrastination.

## Final note

Do not treat this as a guide to be followed step by step.
Treat it as an assistant you return to when stuck.

Build something.
Get feedback.
Charge money.
Repeat.

That is the work.

If, at some point, you need a structured way to reason about demand, distribution, and money together, remember this framework.

Until then, just do.

Fin.
