I have been thinking about how we use AI in our business workflows, especially in the context of product, market, and strategy.

There is a real risk we need to be conscious of.

If we start relying on AI before we have developed a clear perspective of our own, it begins shaping our thinking instead of strengthening it.

AI does not have goals. It does not hold a steady point of view.

We do. We are accountable for outcomes.

That means we must begin with a strong internal hypothesis about what is happening in the market, what we believe will work, and why. AI can refine and pressure test that hypothesis, but it cannot be the source of it.

## What perspective actually means

By perspective, I mean a coherent model of reality.

In business terms, this is our working thesis about the product, the customer, the distribution channel, and the leverage points. This model is built through experience, deliberate thinking, and exposure to high quality operators.

It is hard work, but it is also the highest leverage work we can do.

The quality of our hypothesis determines the quality of experiments we design, the quality of iterations we run, and how effectively we interpret feedback from the real world.

If the hypothesis is shallow, our experiments will be shallow.
If it is deep, our learning compounds.

## Without perspective, iteration becomes noise

Without our own perspective, we have no frame of reference for iteration.

The market is a maze. Every experiment produces details, patterns, signals, and noise. Even something that appears simple contains layers of nuance.

If we do not have a strong base model that is independently formed and well informed, we have nothing to anchor to. We end up reacting to whatever data or AI output is in front of us.

Iteration becomes random movement rather than directional progress.

This is how products become scattered, trying to do too many things, lacking coherence, and feeling unfocused.

We must avoid that at all costs.

## Data without thesis is dangerous

When we run experiments for a client, we generate large amounts of data.

Feeding that data directly into AI will produce patterns, but those patterns are context free. Without a guiding thesis, we risk being pulled in multiple directions.

The data and AI outputs must be interpreted through our existing model. Then we update the model, design the next experiment, and repeat.

This disciplined cycle of hypothesis, experiment, interpretation, and iteration is where durable insight is created.

## The real competitive advantage

That accumulated insight becomes our competitive advantage.

It is not easily replicable because it is embedded in our thinking process, our frameworks, and the way we connect dots across domains.

If we are serious about building strong strategic thinking, this is the culture we need to cultivate:

- Independent thinking first
- Clear hypotheses
- Rigorous experimentation
- AI as a tool, not a substitute for judgment

This is demanding work, but it is the work that leads to real outcomes.
